      "I'm looking for roles in Web Development, AI Integration, or Process Automation Consulting. My strength: I understand both the technical and business sides, so I build solutions that actually work in the real world.",
      "Proof? I built La Skàli from scratch—a CrossFit gym in a highly competitive market. While coaching 72h/week (9am-9pm, Mon-Sat, 6 years, 3 weeks vacation every 2 years), I also handled ALL the tech: website, booking system, custom management app, Meta Ads, SEO, sales funnels, and automation workflows. I replaced €3K/year in SaaS with tools I built myself.",
      "I thrive in high-intensity environments where I need to learn fast, optimize constantly, and deliver results. Whether it's helping companies automate their processes, building web applications, or integrating AI into workflows—I'm ready."
